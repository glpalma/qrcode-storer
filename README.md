# QRCode Reader
## A QR code reader based on Google's MLKit

My first ever Android app!

In this project, my goal was to get used to the basics in Android development: how to start a 
project, how to build a simple UI, how to deal with permissions, how to organize the project's 
files etc. 

Beyond that, I also thought it would be interesting to add AI into the project to start 
immersing myself into this new world.

## Tools used
- Room for storing the QRCodes in a DB
- MLKit for reading data from the QRCodes
- Compose for UI
